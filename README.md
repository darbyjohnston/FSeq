FSeq
====
FSeq is a C library for working with sequences of files. File sequences are
commonly used in the VFX and film industry to represent individual frames of an
animation or film. For example the files:
* render.0001.exr
* render.0002.exr
* render.0003.exr
* render.0004.exr
* render.0005.exr

Can be represented by the file sequence shorthand:
* render.0001-0005.exr

This makes browsing much easier when you have hundreds or thousands of
files in a directory.

FSeq compiles on Linux, OS X, and Windows. A CMakeLists.txt is provided
for building the library, but the code can also be copied directly into
another source tree for use (it consists of a single header and source
file, fseq.h and fseq.c).

FSeq is open source software distributed under a BSD style license. See
the file LICENSE.txt for details.

Example splitting a file name into a path, base name, number, and extension:
    
	#include <fseq/fseq.h>
    ...
    struct FSeqFileName fileName;
    fseqFileNameInit(&fileName);
    fseqFileNameSplit("/tmp/render0100.exr", &fileName);
    printf("%s, %s, %s, %s\n", fileName.path, fileName.base, fileName.number, fileName.extension);
    fseqFileNameDel(&fileName);

Output:

    /tmp/, render, 0100, .exr

Example listing the contents of a directory with file sequences:

    #include <fseq/fseq.h>
    ...
    struct FSeqDirEntry* entries = fseqDirList("/tmp/", NULL, NULL);
    struct FSeqDirEntry* entry = entries;
    while (entry)
    {
        static char buf[FSEQ_STRING_LEN];
        fseqDirEntryToString(entry, buf, FSEQ_FALSE, FSEQ_STRING_LEN);
        printf("%s\n", buf);
        entry = entry->next;
    }
    fseqDirListDel(entries);

Output:

    render.rgba.0001-0100.tif
    render.normals.0001-0100.tif
    render.z.0001-0100.tif
